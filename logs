[16:39:58] <kushal> huzaifas, The stage is yours :)
[16:40:02] <huzaifas> thanks kushal
[16:40:07] <huzaifas> so before i start let me introduce myself
[16:40:24] <huzaifas> My name is Huzaifa Sidhpurwala, i work at Red Hat as Principal Product Security Engineer
[16:40:49] <huzaifas> I am a part of various open source security teams, including Mozilla, Webkit, PHP, python, Xorg etc
[16:41:08] <huzaifas> A fedora contributor in various capacities for the last 7/8 years
[16:41:34] <huzaifas> A freelance security researcher in my spare time, found various flaws etc in different commonly used software component
[16:41:42] <huzaifas> This session is called "Security 101"
[16:41:49] <moizsajid> Roll Call: Moiz Sajid
[16:42:00] <huzaifas> gives a basic introduction to what internet security is, for users
[16:42:01] <anushil05> Anushil Kumar
[16:42:08] <c0mrad3> Roll Call: Tummala Dhanvi
[16:42:21] <huzaifas> if there is any interest, i am take a few follow up sessions as well, depending on what the students are interested in
[16:42:25] <saru> Roll call :saran teja
[16:42:29] <poonam> Roll call: Poonam jaddhav
[16:42:39] <huzaifas> If at any point there are any questions, feel free to ask or ask at the end or maybe later if you remember them
[16:43:04] <huzaifas> So, there are two main topics which i want to discuss today
[16:43:17] <huzaifas> 1. System Security
[16:43:30] <huzaifas> How we can protect our operating system (linux) from attackers
[16:43:42] <huzaifas> 2. Little bit about application security
[16:43:59] <huzaifas> which basically boils down to "how to write secure code"
[16:44:15] <huzaifas> I am assuming most of you guys know a little bit of programming
[16:44:22] <Anandprakash> very interesting topics
[16:44:23] <huzaifas> even if you dont, it is going to be interesting
[16:44:38] <huzaifas> depending on the time we have, we may not finish everything today, in that case, maybe we can do a session 2 of this , depending ofcourse on how interesting or how boring you find my talk :)
[16:44:59] <indiabhi> roll call, Abhishek Rai
[16:45:27] <huzaifas> so lets talk about system security: We will take two things under consideration when talking about system security:
[16:45:31] <madhurii> Roll call: Madhuri Muley
[16:45:41] <huzaifas>  1. We are talking from a user point of view, we will not talk about a system administrator on a server install ie we are not going to talk about how to security apache installation etc
[16:46:11] <huzaifas> 2. We are ofcourse talking about FOSS here, i will take fedora as a example, i dont use gui a lot, so i can try to give command line examples and assume that you can google your way to a possible gui available on fedora :)
[16:46:46] <hemanth> roll call Hemanth Savasere
[16:46:57] <huzaifas> so before talking about how to secure our OS, lets briefly talk about why to secure our system
[16:47:08] <huzaifas> because
[16:47:27] <huzaifas> there are attackers/hackers out there, who want to get into your system and exploit it
[16:47:34] <huzaifas> and why is that?
[16:47:37] <huzaifas> many reasons
[16:47:45] <huzaifas> 1. Financial gain
[16:47:52] <huzaifas> you may have visited your bank website using your browser, the password is still in the cache, if i can gain access to your system i can steal your bank password
[16:48:13] <huzaifas> or made a credit/debit card transaction and some of those details can be stolen
[16:48:30] <huzaifas> you are using password wallets , either built into the browser or are you using some keyring, if i can get the wallet/keyring file, i can brute force the password and get all your details
[16:49:03] <huzaifas> it may take time, depending on how big/complex your password protecting the wallet is, but in this age of GPU/cloud its not impossible
[16:49:09] <huzaifas> i can massively parrallize it :)
[16:49:15] <huzaifas> 2. Spam
[16:49:26] <huzaifas> I can use your machine as a base to send spam, spam is a big business in the underground economy
[16:49:36] <huzaifas> or i can use it as a base to attack other machines
[16:49:51] <Aazad> what is wallet nd kerying refers here ?
[16:50:00] <huzaifas> i can steal your contacts from your machine and use that to attack all your contacts
[16:50:13] <huzaifas> Aazad:  when you login to a web site using google-chrome or mozilla firefox
[16:50:16] <kushal> Aazad, you type ! for any question, and wait for your turn to ask it.
[16:50:24] <huzaifas> you often get a prompt saying "Do you wan to store this password"
[16:50:44] <huzaifas> most browsers have a built in system for storing these passwords, they get retrieved automtically when vistiing the site next time
[16:51:16] <huzaifas> they use some sort of assymmetric/symmetric crypto to store them securely, but its not impossible to crack them, assuming they can be stolen
[16:51:26] <huzaifas> ok so back to our topic at hand
[16:51:40] <huzaifas> 3. Steal information
[16:51:43] <Aazad> firefox doesnot save  that , it ask again n again
[16:52:05] <sandeepk>  /query Aazad
[16:52:07] <huzaifas> i think it needs to be enabled, not sure, idont use it :)
[16:52:16] <huzaifas> your facebook account, your gmail account, your photographs, all of these are can be useful information for the right person
[16:52:36] <c0mrad3> Aazad: as kushal said type ! for any question and WAIT for your turn to ask it!
[16:53:02] <huzaifas> they can be used to attack you, your friends, can be sold underground by people who want to sell you something, or deface your facebook page etc
[16:53:12] <huzaifas> 4. Make it a part of the botnet:
[16:53:23] <huzaifas> This is common in Windows world, but is getting towards linux now, a bot net is a network of slave computers, which a C&C = command and control system, controls
[16:53:37] <huzaifas> its like having sleeper cells in a terrorist network, i can activate of the cells and make it do what ever i want, often used for DDOS
[16:53:55] <huzaifas> or anything else
[16:54:17] <huzaifas> they can also be used to do computation, so for example if i want to brute force a password, i can use computers on my botnet to do all the work for me
[16:54:25] <huzaifas> 5. Fun and fame:
[16:54:47] <huzaifas> Script kiddies - are attackers who hack systems using tools available in the market and have no idea about how tools works, basically novices
[16:55:03] <huzaifas> there are tons of script kiddies out there, who want to hack your system just for fun and to show off
[16:55:18] <huzaifas> so to conclude, we want to keep our money, data, information and esteem, so we want to make sure our system are secure
[16:55:39] <huzaifas> hope you guys get me and i am not going too fast/slow ?
[16:55:47] <vibhcool> !
[16:56:04] <huzaifas> vibhcool:  i think you need to type ! and the question i suppose
[16:56:11] <huzaifas> or not
[16:56:12] <huzaifas> anwyays
[16:56:13] <huzaifas> next
[16:56:41] <vibhcool> huzaifas: your speed is fine :)
[16:56:49] <huzaifas> ok so..
[16:57:00] <huzaifas> we have covered the why part, now lets try to address "how"
[16:57:06] <vibhcool> Is torrent an example of botnet in legal way?
[16:57:13] <huzaifas> lets talk about how to secure your system, i want to give you a few pointers
[16:57:15] <code_geek> !
[16:57:59] <huzaifas> vibhcool:  the torrent protocol contains provision to seed as well as download, so when you download, its expected that your machine will be used for both upload/download
[16:58:27] <huzaifas> in a botnet, you dont know what your machine is being used for, the purpose is mostly malicious
[16:58:28] <huzaifas> next
[16:58:31] <code_geek>  can you give an example of a tool for script kiddies available in market?
[16:58:46] <huzaifas> any of tools suggested by ankit fadia :P
[16:58:53] <gkadam> :D
[16:59:09] <huzaifas> jokes apart, i dont think i want to point you to "tools to attack computers"
[16:59:10] <sandeepk> :D
[16:59:18] <vharsh> !
[16:59:18] <akshays> lol :D
[16:59:21] <code_geek> :D Okay
[16:59:27] <huzaifas> but a general search will give you a lot of information
[16:59:31] <iKshitij> lol :D
[16:59:52] <code_geek> okay, thanks huzaifas
[16:59:57] <huzaifas> so lets continue
[17:00:18] <huzaifas> how to secure your system, a few pointers
[17:00:24] <huzaifas> (this is not a comprehensive guide)
[17:00:30] <huzaifas> 1. passwords:
[17:00:32] <vibhcool> huzaifas: Botnet thing seems interesting :)
[17:00:40] <huzaifas>  There is a lot of talk everywhere about good passwords and why the should be used
[17:00:50] <huzaifas> there was a lot of security research sometime back about it as well
[17:01:00] <huzaifas> The thing about passwords is that, all passwords can be broken via brute force
[17:01:10] <huzaifas> its only a question of time before the password is broken, what we can do is delay the breakage of password via brute via, using a "strong" password
[17:01:21] <huzaifas> a good password is a one which combinations of all the allowed character classes
[17:01:27] <huzaifas> for example, most systems/applications allow a combination of upper case/lower case/ special characters and numbers
[17:01:33] <huzaifas> p@5sw0rD may be a good password
[17:01:44] <huzaifas> longer the passwords, the better it is , is the usual rule of the thumb
[17:01:54] <huzaifas> also ideally passwords should not be dictionary word, those are easily breakable via the so called dictionary attacks
[17:02:00] <huzaifas> in dictionary attacks all the possible words from the dictionary are tried
[17:02:08] <huzaifas> combination of dictionary words along with special characters are usually ok
[17:02:11] <rhnvrm> !
[17:02:18] <huzaifas> next thing: never put your password in a place where it is accessible
[17:02:24] <huzaifas> never write it down in a paper
[17:02:29] <huzaifas> i have known cases where people write down their root passwords in a paste-in note in their cubibles
[17:02:36] <huzaifas> this is not safe, DONT do it :)
[17:02:48] <huzaifas> a question which i often get asked is how to i handle multiple passwords in todays online world
[17:02:55] <huzaifas> this is a truly practical problem, in todays connected world it is often the case, where i have multiple accounts which i need to handle
[17:03:05] <huzaifas> ranging from financial services , social websites, email, etc etc
[17:03:09] * abstatic was about to ask the same question
[17:03:14] <huzaifas> people commonly try to work around this by using the same passwords everywhere
[17:03:18] <huzaifas> this is very very BAD
[17:03:28] <huzaifas> and this is the biggest problem today on the internet, its called password recycle
[17:03:36] <huzaifas> the problem here is that, if one of your account gets compromised due to whatever reason, often due to the fault of the website, the attacker can use this password against other websites and get access to your email etc
[17:03:39] <huzaifas> so what is the solution?
[17:03:43] <vibhcool> !
[17:03:48] <huzaifas>  several solutions have been proposed for this:
[17:03:54] <huzaifas> They range from random password generators to password wallets
[17:04:03] <huzaifas> for an average user a good mechanism is a gpg protected password file
[17:04:10] <huzaifas> one needs to create different , possibly randomly generated password for different accounts, store them in a plain text file and encrypt it using gpg
[17:04:19] <huzaifas> we can decrypt the file for each access to the password
[17:04:31] <huzaifas> but make sure the password your encrypt your gpg file is very strong or the whole purpose is lost :)
[17:04:42] <huzaifas> next
[17:04:46] <vharsh> [quasi-OT] So, use of 'secure' password managers is bad; because ultimately the 'secure' thing gets it on an insecure machine? How can we achieve an entropy for 100+ account password, without having to write it down(90s thing, also bad)? Do you recommend a good password manager, for a) non tech people b) new-to-tech people
[17:05:13] <Anandprakash> !
[17:06:22] <huzaifas> vharsh:  not all password managers are bad, some of them are pretty secure, what you use depends on how paranoid you are, personally i use a gpg encrypted file, my private key is on a hardware device, and its password protected, so multi-factor auth comes into the picture
[17:06:27] <vharsh> I face the same situation, there is a common way non tech people make up a password. Like, name+dob which is similar to the email, adn written down in Facebook.
[17:06:31] <avik> !
[17:06:43] <yASH_> !
[17:06:54] <vharsh> huzaifas, I have been using Lastpass since 2011 I think. It had a major security flaw.
[17:07:20] <huzaifas> vharsh:  so there are ways to generate good passwords, linux has a couple of tools available, which can allow you to generate random passwords of various strengths and sizes, if you do a next session, we can discuss some of them with examples
[17:07:31] <huzaifas> next
[17:07:34] <rhnvrm> huzaifas, should we prefer password length or special characters? password length should take more time to break right? what is the better option?
[17:07:48] <vharsh> huzaifas, In my case paranoid-level = zero. Lastpass was motivated due to sheer laziness :) <EOF>
[17:08:19] <huzaifas> rhnvrm:  a combination of both, most good websites have a minimum for both, they wont accept small and simple passwords, so the right answer here is both :)
[17:08:36] <huzaifas> vharsh:  it also depends on how valuable your information is :)
[17:08:38] <huzaifas> next
[17:08:40] <vharsh> I mean, I use lastpass because I like pressing [alt]+ [G] to generate and store a password.
[17:08:54] <vibhcool> Is it possible to use brute force to crack passwords on google or facebook or any other website, they give 3-4 tries for each trying passwords
[17:09:00] <vibhcool> ?
[17:09:36] <huzaifas> vibhcool:  so two ways of doing that 1. i try various passwords on your online account, all good web sites should block once invalid attempts exceed 3-5 times
[17:09:41] <huzaifas> and will alert the users
[17:09:43] <c0mrad3> !
[17:10:00] <huzaifas> second way is to attack the site and get the password hashes and then break them online
[17:10:04] <huzaifas> offline rather
[17:10:06] <vharsh> vibhcool, https://officechai.com/news/flipkart-employee-gets-a-bounty-of-15000-for-reporting-a-bug-to-facebook/ Bugs :)
[17:10:18] <poonam> !
[17:10:25] <huzaifas> hope that answers your question
[17:10:26] <huzaifas> next
[17:10:29] <Anandprakash> we can add some rules in iptables and some restrictions in  browsers, so is that the good solution to avoid unexpected traffic?
[17:10:50] <vibhcool> Thank you huzaifas, vharsh :)
[17:11:04] <code_geek> !
[17:11:28] <huzaifas> Anandprakash:  both of them arent related, iptables work on the network layer, so for example it can make sure chinese attackers dont brute force you on the ssh port
[17:12:12] <Anandprakash> okay
[17:12:23] <moizsajid> !
[17:12:28] <huzaifas> the browser works on a entirely different level, attackers are trying to steal your online passwords etc, so a good combination is protecting your self on different level, use a good browser, and make sure your system is protected by a good, properly configured firewall
[17:12:31] <huzaifas> next
[17:12:36] <avik> I keep my passwords in pain txt file and then change the extension txt to anything, jpg, dat, etc, and keep in in a secret place.
[17:12:36] <avik> Is is safe, in professional sence?
[17:12:44] <sayan> vharsh: read this? https://labs.detectify.com/2016/07/27/how-i-made-lastpass-give-me-all-your-passwords/
[17:13:14] <vharsh> sayan, Yes I read this one today on Reddit/HN app in class.
[17:13:14] <huzaifas> avik:  its called security via obscurity
[17:13:24] <avik> ha?
[17:13:31] <huzaifas> trying to secure yourself by hiding your data
[17:13:35] <avik> can you please explain
[17:13:48] <pksadiq> !
[17:13:48] <huzaifas> may distract the attacker, but they are smart, remember that :)
[17:13:58] <vibhcool> !
[17:14:04] <huzaifas> and overall not a good solution
[17:14:19] <avik> haha ok.:)
[17:14:20] <huzaifas> and def. not professional
[17:14:21] <huzaifas> next
[17:14:23] <yASH_> I use yubikey for strong authentication to how much extent is it secure ?
[17:14:43] <huzaifas> yASH_:  do you use yubikey to generate one time passwords?
[17:14:54] <yASH_> No for two factor authentication
[17:14:58] <huzaifas> right
[17:15:08] <huzaifas> its not been broken yet, so pretty strong so far
[17:15:19] <huzaifas> also the algorithm is open
[17:15:34] <huzaifas> so anyone can see how it works, but its one wayness is established mathematically
[17:15:40] <huzaifas> so pretty strong security there
[17:15:42] <huzaifas> next
[17:15:45] <yASH_> Thank you !! I was pretty skeptic about that
[17:15:45] <c0mrad3> huzaifas: what is your typical day work at RedHat, do you work with Fedora security team ?
[17:17:00] <huzaifas> c0mrad3:  slightly outside the scope of our discussion, i did do some work with fedora security team previously, but i mostly dont find any time currently + Red Hat work is tightly integrated with fedora, so anything i dont in RH affects fedora indirectly :)
[17:17:01] <huzaifas> next
[17:17:06] <poonam> can you suggest some good password manager to have more secure password
[17:17:34] <fhackdroid> !
[17:18:18] <huzaifas> poonam:  password managers are used to store your passwords, i have not used into any gui based password managers yet, though if you want i can try to look and get back to you, i think bruce schiener suggested a few, i mostly use my gpg/tui method
[17:18:38] <huzaifas> but maybe i can look at a few, and get back to you next time!
[17:18:39] <poonam> okay
[17:18:40] <huzaifas> next
[17:18:45] <code_geek> How prime numbers are used by companies like google or facebook for encryption of password of their users?
[17:19:04] <huzaifas> code_geek:  ah big topic, prime numbers are the backbone of cryptography
[17:19:41] <huzaifas> if you have heard of RSA or DHKE or ECC, these are asym algorigthms you use every day to securely transmit your gmail/facebook etc passwords on the internet
[17:20:06] <huzaifas> they ensure that the encrypted packets are not vulnerable to mitm (man in the middle ) attacks
[17:20:31] <huzaifas> the above being said, its a huge topic, some day if we do some session on basic cryptography, i can talk more about it
[17:20:32] <huzaifas> next
[17:20:58] <moizsajid> In PGP, we will be using password, in this case the key, to get other passwords. Doesn't it sound counter intuitive?
[17:21:24] <code_geek> Okay, I'll search the web for more details. Thanks. I hope we get some time to do a session on basic cryptography
[17:21:35] <huzaifas> not really, the trick is not to have the private key on the same machine as the encrypted time
[17:21:45] <huzaifas> and that is also slightly how the other password managers work
[17:22:10] <huzaifas> making sure the files which store the passwords are encrypted themselves and they can only be unlocked via a "master password"
[17:22:35] <huzaifas> also the key is protected by a passworde
[17:22:47] <huzaifas> so private key + password is used to unlock the file, which contains my passwords
[17:22:54] <huzaifas> the public key is used to encrypt it
[17:23:00] <huzaifas> next
[17:23:06] <pksadiq> How much should we be concerned about the possibilities of remote administration tools like intel ME be cracked (or about presence of backdoors in it), and about the backdoors that may be present in non-free software pieces, like *may* be in linux binary blobs (As we know that malwares are very common in M$ Windows world).
[17:23:08] <Anandprakash> !
[17:23:50] <vibhcool> huzaifas: What are examples of vulnerabilities excluding sql injection and preventing user from trying more than 3-4 passwords for a website or a network?
[17:23:53] <huzaifas> pksadiq:  the bigger question is what you can about them
[17:24:10] <abstatic> !
[17:24:18] <vibhcool> I am sorry i posted my question by mistake :(
[17:24:27] <pksadiq> huzaifas: for the case of linux kernel, may be I can use a freed version
[17:24:37] <huzaifas> 1. even if you use open source tools ,are they secure, do you have the expertise to look at the its code and figure out if its properly written, for example when you use open ssl do you have the expertise to analyse its code
[17:24:57] <huzaifas> 2. there is a limit to what you can do with open source, for example all code uses the cpu right?
[17:25:12] <huzaifas> what if there is backdoor in the cpu, even if there is, what can you do about it
[17:25:29] <huzaifas> 3. what is no free software is available for your use, do you stop working ?
[17:26:08] <huzaifas> so there is a line you have to draw here, try to be as secure/paranoid as you can, but your cant build your own computer from scratch, so you have to trust someone at the end
[17:26:31] <pksadiq> Yeah. I'm trying to.
[17:27:00] <huzaifas> so i can take only one question, have a meeting at 9:00, i can answer rest of the questions next time/next session
[17:27:01] <huzaifas> next
[17:27:05] <vibhcool> huzaifas: What are examples of vulnerabilities excluding sql injection and preventing user from trying more than 3-4 passwords for a website or a network?
[17:28:19] <huzaifas> vibhcool:  are you asking about "how to brute force an online website account assuming the password hashes cannot be retried and there is a limit on the nunmber of wrong attempts i am allowed" ?
[17:29:36] <vibhcool> I am asking how a website or a network can be attacked excluding sql injection and brute force method
[17:29:40] <vibhcool> ?
[17:29:41] <vharsh> vibhcool, Saw the link? That flipkart guy got >3 numebr of attempts to enter the SMS-OTP, on beta.facebook.com
[17:29:51] <vharsh> s/numebr/number
[17:29:59] <fhackdroid> huzaifas, I am aking any how and reply when you get time. :) What are the best sources where one can learn about security ?
[17:30:17] <huzaifas> vibhcool:  there are a few methods, not sure if i should discuss them here though
[17:30:43] <huzaifas> fhackdroid:  ok, last question, the answer is simple "internet", no books can give you the most recent knowledge
[17:30:46] <vibhcool> vharsh: yes that was a brute force  method
[17:30:53] <huzaifas> anyways, time to leave, seeya guys next time
[17:31:30] <fhackdroid> hahah damn :P I will catch him next time :P
[17:31:36] <vharsh> huzaifas' typing :)
[17:31:37] <moizsajid> huzaifas: Great session Huzaifa!
[17:31:42] <code_geek> bye huzaifas, great session :)
[17:32:18] <vharsh> I was like, "wait a second, is he doing a cut-paste operation?"
[17:32:32] <abstatic> fhackdroid, have you seen this course - http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-858-computer-systems-security-fall-2014/
[17:32:52] <abstatic> fhackdroid, pretty high level stuff about computer security
[17:33:14] <Aazad> a great session guyss....
[17:33:19] <vharsh> There's a book called Secure Coding from O'rielly, thats all I know about secure coding :p

[17:04:11] <mbuf> I am Shakthi Kannan (@shakthimaan) and today I will be discussing on "Time Management"
[17:04:20] <anushil051> Anushil Kumar
[17:04:42] <mbuf> This session will go on till 2130 IST, and I am happy to take questions during the session
[17:05:12] <shauryak_3> Shaurya Kalia
[17:05:27] <mbuf> Time is a very important dimension in our life, and that is something that we need to keep track of effectively
[17:05:32] <amey> Amey Jain
[17:05:42] googledocs is now known as acetakwas
[17:06:02] <acetakwas> Roll Call: Tosin Animashaun
[17:06:20] <mbuf> Being on-time is a good habit and a very difficult one to keep up
[17:06:32] <code_geek> Roll Call: Shantanu Acharya
[17:06:45] <mbuf> But, the discipline will definitely help you in the long run.
[17:07:02] <mbuf> Time lost is lost. Unfortunately, there is no undo or redo button (except in Git).
[17:07:36] <mbuf> Hence, the first thing that I would like all of you to do is to keep track of the time that you spend working with free and open source software.
[17:07:38] <devyani7> Roll Call: Devyani
[17:08:22] <mbuf> This can be time spent on 1. reading (search engines, Stack Overflow, books, forums etc.)
[17:08:35] <mbuf> 2. Time that you spend writing and testing code
[17:08:47] <mbuf> 3. Time that you spend on doing documentation, or writing blogs
[17:09:01] <mbuf> 4. Time that you spend debugging an issue or bug
[17:09:18] <yajushi> Roll Call: Yajushi Srivastava
[17:09:18] <mbuf> 5. Time that you spend on IRC channel
[17:09:50] <mbuf> I would like you to monitor this for a week, to begin with.
[17:10:00] <himanshutechy> Himanshu sharma
[17:10:22] <mbuf> At the end of the first week, if you have measured it honestly, you will know how much time you have sincerely spent on the tasks.
[17:10:38] <mbuf> You can then project as to how much time, you intend to spend in the following weeks.
[17:11:13] <jogender> roll call: Jogender Kota
[17:11:17] <mbuf> You can of course, do this exercise for other things that you do, and not necessarily for just the free and open source software work that you do.

[17:11:41] <madhurii> Roll call: Madhuri Muley
[17:11:58] <real56> Roll Call:Varsha R
[17:11:58] <mbuf> For example, you can clock time on travelling (car, bus, auto, train etc.) to school, work. The time that you spend watching television.
[17:12:28] <mbuf> The time that you spend shopping, watching a movie etc.
[17:12:58] <mbuf> You do not need share this info with anyone, because, it is your private data. But, it is something you must do because we have only 24 hours.
[17:13:25] <mbuf> Hence, the first and foremost step is to collect data. If you really want to see improvement, you should be honest in this exercise.
[17:13:44] <cosmologist10> roll call:shweta suman
[17:13:56] <mbuf> Cooking up numbers is not going to help you. There are different free and open source software available for this too!
[17:14:25] <mbuf> I have experimented with Hamster in the past
[17:14:27] <mbuf> link https://projecthamster.wordpress.com/screenshots/
[17:15:01] * SpEcHiDe installing hAmster
[17:15:53] <mbuf> If you like C and are GTK+ fan, you can try Planner
[17:16:03] <mbuf> link https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Planner/Screenshots
[17:16:16] <mbuf> If you like C++ and are a KDE fan, you can try TaskJuggler
[17:16:25] <mbuf> link http://www.taskjuggler.org/
[17:17:11] <mbuf> I use GNU Emacs and Org mode. There are lot of write-ups and setups available for this too.
[17:17:41] <mbuf> link http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html#Clocking
[17:18:13] <mbuf> You do not necessarily have to be a time freak, clocking everything you do.
[17:18:20] <priyanka> I got disconnected, someone please tell what i missed?
[17:18:35] <mbuf> For example, you do not need to track time spent with family.
[17:18:54] <mbuf> priyanka: the logs will be available later
[17:19:30] <priyanka> okay thank you mbuf.
[17:19:46] <mbuf> If you collect data for few months, you will know how much time you have spent on what, and this will help you to plan your work
[17:20:38] <mbuf> You could have a yearly plan, say, by next year, you will have learn to write professional websites using Django (for example)
[17:21:10] <mbuf> You should then break this goal, into monthly targets, which in turn should be broken down into weekly tasks.
[17:21:27] o is now known as Guest34218
[17:21:29] <mbuf> You should then plan your daily tasks accordingly.
[17:21:36] <mbuf> Divider and conquer algorithm :)
[17:22:04] <mbuf> Of course, not all will go as per schedule. Demos always work on the developer machines, and fail at the customer site.
[17:22:18] <Guest34218> Roll call: Onkar Karale
[17:22:39] <mbuf> With experience, you will get to making a good judgement on how long it will take you to do a task.
[17:22:53] <mbuf> There are project management styles like Scrum, Kanban that you can follow.
[17:23:31] <mbuf> But, that is a personal choice. For example, in Emacs there is a scrum-mode available
[17:23:33] <mbuf> link https://github.com/ianxm/emacs-scrum/blob/master/scrum-template.org.txt
[17:24:12] <mbuf> If you are working in a project, then the project will have its own release schedule
[17:24:29] <mbuf> You can then plan your timeline, based on the project that you want to work with as well
[17:24:48] <mbuf> But, the most important point is to be *conscious* of time, and that the clock is ticking
[17:25:11] <mbuf> Time lost can never be regained. I am not saying that you should not waste time on social media websites.
[17:25:22] <mbuf> But, try to use them to a minimum.
[17:25:40] <mbuf> You are measured on the productivity of your work, and your work will reflect on the same.
[17:26:16] <mbuf> You can have weekly or bi-weekly reviews of the time that you have spent
[17:26:25] <mbuf> or as and when you complete a project a big milestone.
[17:27:28] <mbuf> This is the gist of what I wanted to convey to you all today.
[17:27:36] <mbuf> We can now have a Q&A session.
[17:27:46] <moizsajid> !
[17:27:51] <mbuf> next
[17:28:05] <moizsajid> Some much time should be spend on Social Media?
[17:28:10] <moizsajid> *we
[17:28:29] <moizsajid> How much time should we spend on Social Media?
[17:28:49] <mbuf> moizsajid: The question should be what do you want from Social Media?
[17:28:56] <abstatic> !
[17:29:11] <mbuf> moizsajid: You can waste all your time on that, but, at the end of the day, have you learnt anything new?
[17:29:18] <mbuf> moizsajid: have you made a difference?
[17:29:51] <mbuf> moizsajid: BTW, I am not against social media. I do spend time with it too, but, to a minimum. It should not affect your work, basically.
[17:30:13] <mbuf> moizsajid: you should learn to keep your distractions to a minimum when you work.
[17:30:15] <mbuf> next
[17:30:17] <abstatic> While working should we switch off our mobile phones and other distractions (like listening to songs while working ?) for more focus ? H
[17:30:34] <abstatic> Please ignore the trailing "H", accidental.
[17:30:55] <priyanka> !
[17:31:23] <mbuf> abstatic: Phones are useful if you have to receive emergency calls. You could keep them in silent.
[17:31:37] <indiabhi> !
[17:31:47] <mbuf> abstatic: But, I have seen more people using it every n minutes, and when you are seriously doing work, it can be a big distraction.
[17:32:14] <mbuf> abstatic: we are building complex software, and it takes at least ten minutes for the human to recollect what was he/she working before the distraction
[17:32:49] <mbuf> abstatic: some people like listening to music when working. It depends on the nature of the work. If I am doing critical work, I like a quiet place so the mind can do its work. YMMV.
[17:33:08] <mbuf> abstatic: it is good to learn to work completely offline (disconnect Internet, use offline docs).
[17:33:15] <mbuf> next
[17:33:20] <priyanka> mbuf, as you said we should minimize spending time on social media, so what are some other ways to minimize distractions when we are working?
[17:34:08] <mbuf> priyanka: Social media and phones are the major causes of distraction that I have noticed
[17:34:34] <mbuf> priyanka: it is also good to take occasional breaks. You do not want to sit before the computer for long hours. You can use Workrave, for example.
[17:34:44] <mbuf> link http://www.workrave.org/
[17:35:05] <priyanka> but i use phones rarely, i mean some other ways?
[17:35:05] <mbuf> priyanka: television is another big distraction
[17:35:25] <mbuf> priyanka: if you do not have many distractions, then focus on your work and start clocking time.
[17:35:35] <mbuf> priyanka: see how well you can improve on whatever task you are doing
[17:35:40] <moizsajid> +1 for workrave
[17:35:55] <mbuf> priyanka: if you can implement a feature in 3 hours, see if you can do the same work in 1 1/2 hours.
[17:35:58] <mbuf> next
[17:36:04] <priyanka> okay thank you mbuf
[17:36:07] <indiabhi> I have a very strong desire to contribute to FOSS but I am busy with my internship work during daytime and I can not get time to interact with mentors on mailing list and irc. How should I plan ahead so I could spare time for interactions here as well as mentors elsewhere, and then go on contributing successfully to FOSS projects?
[17:36:07] <pabitrakumarpati> eyeleo is another one mbuf
[17:36:15] <mbuf> priyanka: welcome
[17:36:43] <priyanka> :)
[17:36:55] <mbuf> pabitrakumarpati: where is the source code for eyeleo?
[17:37:19] <mbuf> indiabhi: the *nix philosophy is to do one thing and to do it well
[17:37:43] <abhishekg5> !
[17:37:51] <mbuf> You should read the book on "Linux and the Unix philosophy" by Mike Gancarz
[17:37:54] <mbuf> link http://www.amazon.in/Linux-UNIX-Philosophy-Mike-Gancarz/dp/1555582737
[17:38:13] <indiabhi> mbuf, So what do you say I should completely abandon the idea of contributing to FOSS for sometime?
[17:38:19] <pabitrakumarpati> mbuf, I don't think it's an open-source software :- http://eyeleo.com/
[17:38:27] <mbuf> indiabhi: if you think you can spend an hour in the night, without it affecting your health, you can pick your tasks accordingly
[17:38:34] <mbuf> indiabhi: small drops make a mighty ocean
[17:38:45] <mbuf> pabitrakumarpati so we will not talk about it here :)
[17:39:17] <mbuf> indiabhi: the nature of the tasks will determine the team. If you are a maintainer for a project that has many users, then it can take up a lot of your time
[17:39:18] <pabitrakumarpati> ha ha. OKay :)
[17:39:39] <mbuf> indiabhi: so, you can still contribute to F/OSS if you little time, but, choose your tasks accordingly
[17:39:41] <mbuf> next
[17:39:46] <abhishekg5> A lot of programmers experiment. As in they try frontend, backend, cp etc or other different aspects of development. Many of us don't exactly know what is our field. We just do things. What to try first, Or if something we tried and disliked then what should we try next. A lot of time is wasted in just choosing this. How would you suggest managing this ?
[17:40:15] <indiabhi> mbuf, thanks a lot for your insights, I would plan accordingly and spare some time at night :)
[17:40:16] <mbuf> abhishekg5: what is your favorite ice cream?
[17:40:36] <abhishekg5> mbuf, many
[17:40:39] <mbuf> abhishekg5: how did you decide that?
[17:40:59] <abhishekg5> I ate them
[17:41:26] <indiabhi> and thanks for the book recommendation mbuf , would definitely go through it, you may carry on :)
[17:41:45] <mbuf> abhishekg5: The same applies to work. You need to try them. The advantage of F/OSS is that if you do not like working on front-end, you can leave the project
[17:42:38] <abhishekg5> mbuf, Exactly. I know I can. But till how long should I stick to a thing. Managing time in this seems difficult
[17:43:00] <mbuf> abhishekg5: you take a task for a beginner, estimated for, say a week
[17:43:16] <mbuf> abhishekg5: if you can get it done, and you enjoy working on it, and the tools, then you are fine
[17:43:30] <mbuf> abhishekg5: else, you try something else
[17:43:47] <mbuf> abhishekg5: are you studying/working (if I may ask)?
[17:44:00] <mbuf> abhishekg5: ideally, these experiments need to be done during college days
[17:44:07] <abhishekg5> yeah, college student mbuf
[17:44:14] <mbuf> abhishekg5: so, by the time you graduate you know what you want to do in life
[17:44:34] <mbuf> next
[17:44:50] <amey> !
[17:44:54] <mbuf> I shall also recommend my book on working with free and open source software projects, "i want 2 do project. tell me wat 2 do."
[17:45:12] <abhishekg5> mbuf, a lot this improves with experience on working things too. I have experienced it. Thanks
[17:45:12] <mbuf> link http://shakthimaan.com/what-to-do.html
[17:45:26] <meamitk> !
[17:45:45] <mbuf> abhishekg5: it takes 10 years to master programming. Read Peter Norvig's essay.

[17:46:18] <amey> what to work upon?
[17:46:31] <mbuf> amey: what is your domain of interest?
[17:46:53] <amey> Operating systems,Linux,C
[17:46:54] <mbuf> amey: go through my presentation on "Careers with GNU/Linux"
[17:46:55] <mbuf> link http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/careers.with.gnu.linux.pdf
[17:47:21] <amey> OK,I will :)
[17:47:28] <mbuf> amey: so the job profile that you are looking for is a System Engineer/Kernel developer/Embedded programmer
[17:47:31] <mbuf> next
[17:47:35] <meamitk> i read your book and it's really helpful
[17:47:41] <mbuf> meamitk: thanks!
[17:47:46] <abhishekg5> mbuf, yes, I read that. It's a good read :)
[17:47:50] <meamitk> whenever i tried to learn only office thoughts are come in mind
[17:47:54] <mbuf> abhishekg5: thanks!
[17:48:01] <mbuf> meamitk: office thoughts?

[17:48:38] <pabitrakumarpati> Even if I want to contribute to FOSS, I can't because of my office working hours. And I know, there are lot who are willing to contribute, but the work pressure and timing does not allow them. what will be your suggestion for those who are working?
[17:49:07] <mbuf> pabitrakumarpati: Why don't you find a job where they appreciate F/OSS work?
[17:49:16] <mbuf> pabitrakumarpati: and will give you the time to learn?
[17:49:21] <meamitk> whenever i tried to learn first thought in my mind is how can i use this in office work
[17:49:39] <mbuf> meamitk: do not confuse learning with office work
[17:49:59] <mbuf> pabitrakumarpati: you cannot go to a vegetarian restaurant and ask for non-veg
[17:50:16] <mbuf> meamitk: an ideal job will be to work with F/OSS at work
[17:50:28] <pabitrakumarpati> does not that demands me to having experience of working for FOSS or any open source project ?
[17:50:31] <mbuf> meamitk: there are jobs that do exist like that, you have to network in the F/OSS community to find that out
[17:50:51] <PrashantJ> pabitrakumarpati, exactly my question:)
[17:50:53] <mbuf> meamitk: if the company where you work do not appreciate the culture around F/OSS, then you need to find another job
[17:51:23] <pabitrakumarpati> PrashantJ, that's why I told a lot like me :)
[17:51:24] <mbuf> pabitrakumarpati: there are lot of start-ups, who do not see experience
[17:51:32] <mbuf> pabitrakumarpati: they only see attitude and potential
[17:51:52] <mbuf> pabitrakumarpati: if all that you want to work with F/OSS, and a company is working on it, you should be confident to apply and prove yourself
[17:52:12] <meamitk> mbuf, understood thanks
[17:52:19] <mbuf> if you are afraid to experiment, then you are in the wrong industry.
[17:52:35] <pabitrakumarpati> mbuf, yes I know. in start up of course I will learn a lot of things. but i am not sure if I could get time to contribute to FOSS there.
[17:52:38] <mbuf> or find a service job in one of the many MNCs.
[17:53:01] <mbuf> pabitrakumarpati: it all depends on your work, and your agreement in the work place.
[17:53:04] <mbuf> next
[17:53:08] <d1ndra> mbuf, Thanks for your insight into time management. Also, what kind of job profile would you recommend for someone into ML and Python? And any recommended projects?
[17:53:10] <abhishekg5> pabitrakumarpati, many of them support F/OSS culture
[17:53:39] <d1ndra> * F/OSS projects
[17:53:58] <pabitrakumarpati> thanks mbuf
[17:54:07] <mbuf> d1ndra: a Data Scientist/Data Analytics/ML Engineer are job profiles that I have seen online
[17:54:08] <PrashantJ> Thank you mbuf :)
[17:54:40] <mbuf> d1ndra: Most of the ML folks are using Python. Wait for my blog post. You will find lot of references.
[17:54:50] <mbuf> pabitrakumarpati: PrashantJ welcome
[17:54:51] <mbuf> next
[17:54:55] <vharsh> mbuf, I am a college student, I have to manage a 75% attendance. Teachers expect us to write notes(straight out from books/websites), which could be given to us in print. How can I manage my time if I have 18 hours a day for 5 days a week, considering most of the six hours of classroom go waste. The course goes really slow in the beginning, and really fast in the end to make up, thus promoting the learn by rote.
[17:55:08] <d1ndra> Alright, thanks mbuf  :)
[17:55:38] ksaikiranr__ is now known as ksaikiranr
[17:56:25] <mbuf> vharsh: sorry, you are occupied 18 hours  per day? may I ask what you are studying?
[17:56:50] <vharsh> Computer Science Engineering, bachelors
[17:57:02] <abhishekg5> mbuf, he has 18 hours
[17:57:11] <vharsh> No, I mean I have 18 hours to spare.
[17:57:17] <mbuf> vharsh: do you know in advance what notes you need to write?
[17:57:39] <mbuf> vharsh: that is a lot of time to spare!
[17:57:48] <mbuf> vharsh: whatever you need to do in college, just follow it.
[17:57:49] <vharsh> Somewhat. I have seniors note book, which I show to teachers to get 15 marks for internals.
[17:58:00] <mbuf> vharsh: do not fight the system. Use the spare time that you have wisely.
[17:58:15] <vharsh> Would it be rude to contact the teachers?
[17:58:36] <mbuf> vharsh: you can take writing notes as a means to improve yourself. If you can write answers in your own words, for example.
[17:58:53] <vharsh> mbuf, You got me wrong. Teachers dictate notes to us.
[17:58:59] <buvanesh_kumar> !
[17:59:17] <vharsh> So an average class is like 4 pages of an average sized notebook.
[17:59:23] <mbuf> vharsh: just do what the teachers tell you to do in the class. Do not push them with your agenda
[17:59:43] <vharsh> Ok, I'll try my best.<EOF>
[17:59:56] <mbuf> vharsh: if you can learn something from class, well and good. Otherwise, whatever you want to learn, you can learn from working with F/OSS projects
[18:00:21] <mbuf> vharsh: some teachers are lenient. Some are strict.
[18:00:22] <mbuf> next
[18:00:25] <mbuf> next
[18:00:32] <mbuf> Okay, the last question for the day.
[18:00:47] <buvanesh_kumar> Is it good? concentrating on multiple things in a day?
[18:00:57] <mbuf> buvanesh_kumar: give me an example
[18:01:35] <mbuf> vharsh: you could use the note taking exercise to improve your handwriting (if it helps)
[18:01:54] <mbuf> vharsh: given that you have a lot of spare time, you should not complain :)
[18:02:11] <buvanesh_kumar> for an example, i want to learn  more about docker, ansible, python and as well as contribute to open source and etc with in 3 months.
[18:02:21] <vharsh> mbuf, It is depressing if that 6 hours are productive time of the day.
[18:02:49] <vharsh> Moreover, our teachers are somewhat discouraging.
[18:03:06] <vharsh> I try to not listen in the class.
[18:03:07] <mbuf> vharsh: the time that you spend and get work done is productive. Not, the time that you think is the productive time of the day.
[18:03:20] <mbuf> vharsh: discouraging what?
[18:03:33] <mbuf> buvanesh_kumar: that is an achievable target.
[18:03:40] <vharsh> yes.
[18:03:54] <buvanesh_kumar> can you please explain me mbuf
[18:03:55] <vharsh> They underestimate us, each time.
[18:03:57] <mbuf> buvanesh_kumar: Few weeks to learn Python, a month each for Docker and Ansible.
[18:04:12] <mbuf> buvanesh_kumar: you are looking for a DevOps role
[18:04:23] <buvanesh_kumar> yes :) mbuf
[18:04:31] <buvanesh_kumar> you got the point
[18:04:43] <abhishekg5> vharsh, 80% Indian professors are discouraging in every college here. Don't depend on them much. They do everything but teach
[18:04:46] <mbuf> vharsh: if you know who you are, and what you are capable of, why does it matter what other people say?
[18:05:31] <vharsh> mbuf, you are right. I should try to be more resilient.
[18:05:44] <mbuf> vharsh: you need to read the book by Richard Feynman on "What do you care what other people think?"
[18:05:50] <mbuf> link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Do_You_Care_What_Other_People_Think%3F
[18:06:12] <buvanesh_kumar> my doubt is in execution of this time. for an example, can i separate time for each topic in a day? or first concentrate on one thing hereafter completion concentrate on another topic
[18:06:15] <abstatic> vharsh, i was also in the same situation as you some time back. What i did was that I did "just the bare minimum" required to complete the coursework and focused all my energy doing things I liked.
[18:06:16] <mbuf> vharsh: that is their opinion, and leave it that. The more you worry about what they said, you are wasting your time not doing what you are supposed to be doing
[18:06:35] <mbuf> vharsh: and they would have won. That is why "time management" is important, and hence this session
[18:06:49] <mbuf> buvanesh_kumar: 1. Python 2. Ansible 3. Docker
[18:07:04] <buvanesh_kumar> and more things are there.
[18:07:06] <mbuf> vharsh: you should not talk back, but, learn to agree to disagree
[18:07:09] <pabitrakumarpati> buvanesh_kumar, mbuf told about *nix philosophy -- one at a time :)
[18:07:46] <mbuf> So, I will end the class now. Will be online for sometime.
[18:07:59] <mbuf> We can have follow-up discussions in the mailing list.
[18:08:07] <buvanesh_kumar> understood :) pabitrakumarpati mbuf
[18:08:14] <buvanesh_kumar> thanks mbuf :)
[18:08:21] <pabitrakumarpati> buvanesh_kumar, :)
[18:08:47] <vharsh> Thanks mbuf. I'll try to make the best of the 18 hours I have.
[18:09:17] <mbuf> vharsh: yes, please do.

[15:14:57] <kushal> Any question?
[15:14:59] <vharsh> I have to look at the time stamps to understand who started the thread, etc
[15:15:10] <rtnpro> vharsh, but don't overdo it, as it will make your mail difficult to read
[15:15:22] <vharsh> Please, elaborate the digest mode part,sometime (page#17)
[15:16:02] <rtnpro> vharsh, digest mode means that you get a bunch of mailing list mails (once a week, say) at once
[15:16:20] <kushal> Someone please paste a link to a digest mode reply :)
[15:16:38] <rtnpro> vharsh, it's not that useful if you really want to be interactive in a mailing list conversation
[15:16:40] <vharsh> What mistake has happened? Has some user copied the previous email?

[15:19:21] <praveenkumar> pabitra: go ahead with your question.
[15:19:27] <pabitra> went through the digest mail... still not clear
[15:19:46] <pabitra> does it collects only the highlighted texts from each mail ?
[15:20:06] <pabitra> or bunches 10-15 mails in one and delivers it ??
[15:20:07] <Ultimatepritam> moizsajid, he forgot to change the subject line, and so the conversation continued on same thread. Is this a example of Digest mode ?
[15:20:21] <tabrez> kushal,sorry i got late,just came from office
[15:20:32] <kushal> tabrez, no problem
[15:20:58] <lambainsaan> pabitra: Digest Mail means you get one mail in a week, but it is a summary of whatever other people got over the week.
[15:21:13] <SRvSaha> kushal: Is the digest mail randomly selecting some of the mails from the previous mails in a week and sending them at a time.?
[15:21:37] <moizsajid_> Ultimatepritam, I guess so. Can anybody comment on it?
[15:21:48] <kushal> https://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-admin/node19.html
[15:21:55] <pabitra> same question as of SRvSaha
[15:21:57] <akshays> even i have the same doubt as SRvSaha
[15:22:16] <acetakwas> Digest mode works based on your type of subscription. It is user-specific in a way.
[15:22:23] <yoda__> hi.. sorry iam late
[15:22:41] <sayan> next
[15:22:47] <acetakwas> If you subscribe for mails "per day," then you'd get batch of emails at the end of each day
[15:22:49] <kushal> basically it is bad.
[15:22:55] <sayan> kushal: +1
[15:22:56] <acetakwas> That is if there are any emails for that day
[15:23:15] <sayan> No more questions?
[15:23:16] <kushal> acetakwas, Thanks for the explanation :)
[15:23:18] <SRvSaha> acetakwas: +1
[15:23:19] <indiabhi> hi got late as well, read the conversation.
[15:23:20] <indiabhi> !
[15:23:24] <sayan> next
[15:23:33] <acetakwas> However, if you subscribe for a week or some other time frame, then the batches would come after that time
[15:23:36] <indiabhi> what does mailman does?
[15:23:48] <kushal> indiabhi, please do not ask questions directly
[15:23:52] <acetakwas> Yes, kushal is right.
[15:23:55] <kushal> indiabhi, type ! and wait for your turn.
[15:24:07] <sayan> indiabhi: https://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/

[15:24:23] <praveenkumar> next
[15:24:23] <sayan> next
[15:24:35] <AndroUser> +1 means ?
[15:24:37] <Ultimatepritam> acetakwas, As when I subscribe to any wordpress blogs there I can see some Delivery Frequency options
[15:24:50] <sayan> AndroUser: I support you on that comment
[15:24:50] <praveenkumar> AndroUser: you agree on someone's point.
[15:25:13] <AndroUser> thanks
[15:25:20] <yASH_> AndroUser: it means that you support a point. Usually people Call it kudos
[15:25:36] <yoda__> !
[15:25:37] <abstatic> !
[15:25:39] <sayan> next
[15:25:44] <acetakwas> Ultimatepritam::  That is not a mailing list
[15:25:51] PrashantJ_ is now known as PrashantJ
[15:25:55] <indiabhi> !
[15:25:59] <yoda__> what is the topic for today's class?
[15:26:05] <acetakwas> That means you want the blog/site to send you periodic emails about their service/product
[15:26:23] <acetakwas> You usually don't reply to such emails
[15:26:33] <sayan> yoda__: primarily Q/A on the communication guidelines
[15:26:55] <acetakwas> yoda__::  Mostly, question and answers so far.
[15:27:04] <yoda__> !
[15:27:14] <praveenkumar> next
[15:27:19] <sayan> yoda__: communication is one of the important foundation in open source
[15:27:22] <sayan> next
[15:27:31] <srinidhir> !
[15:27:34] <sayan> next
[15:27:37] <abstatic> What is "GPG-signed email that comes with header/footer" ?
[15:27:49] <indiabhi> I guess my college uses mailman, so we had a problem in which there was a trouble relating to storage space, basically it creates another attachment everytime user sends another email how does gmail and other mail services handles it?
[15:28:12] <praveenkumar> abstatic: https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x135.html
[15:28:14] <Ultimatepritam> acetakwas, Thank you. I think I understood. :)
[15:28:16] iKshitij is now known as Guest30131
[15:28:51] <yoda__> can you elaborate why communication is so important in open source?
[15:29:08] <acetakwas> Ultimatepritam::  :)
[15:29:24] <sayan> indiabhi: scaling the storage server!?
[15:29:49] <Ultimatepritam> yoda__ : because OpenSource is a Community of free minded people.
[15:29:58] <snarwade> yoda__, communication is important because open source is driven by community
[15:30:04] <sdas> yoda__: communication is important everywhere...that's how people will understand and will help you
[15:30:17] <rahuldecoded_> yoda__ developing is not one hand task. that's why we need to communicate. In open source we reach people through out the globe
[15:30:36] <sayan> yoda__: so primary we communicate via IRC/Mailing list so you need to follow the guidelines so that the person you are communicating to understands
[15:30:39] <praveenkumar> yoda__: 1. if you don't communicate then nobody will know about your work. 2. you might endup wasting lot of time for a problem which is already solved
[15:30:55] <sayan> next
[15:30:59] <srinidhir> Can we get the schedule of topics covered, it would really help pre class prep!
[15:31:09] <indiabhi> sayan, probably using some data structure to keep track of different attachments sent to multiple user and storing it in just one place rather than duplicating it.
[15:31:10] <abhishekcs10> !
[15:31:21] <kushal> srinidhir, Nope, as it is still difficult for us to make that.
[15:31:26] <acetakwas> yoda__:: Communication allows people working on a project to understand themselves.
[15:31:41] <indiabhi> anyways mailman came to my mind, will go through their doc and visit there irc for further discussion :0
[15:31:53] <praveenkumar> next
[15:31:54] <yoda__> i got it.
[15:31:57] <abhishekcs10> how do we use Wiki for documentation...??
[15:32:07] <acetakwas> yoda__::  You can communicate via IRC (like this), mailing list, Slack or more channels.
[15:32:22] <Anandprakash_> Hi,can anyone please tell me how to join summer training
[15:32:27] <kushal> abhishekcs10, You write things in a wiki, and others will read it.
[15:32:31] <kushal> That is how.
[15:32:37] <prashaant> Anandprakash_, fill the google form on dgplug.org
[15:32:40] <kushal> Anandprakash_, you are in the training.
[15:32:48] <Anandprakash_> I have filled
[15:32:49] <rahuldecoded_> abhishekcs10 Wiki documentation help end user the use their product. If acts like a guide.
[15:32:51] <kushal> Anandprakash_, Attend the sessions here.
[15:33:04] <Anandprakash_> okay
[15:33:05] <rahuldecoded_> *IT
[15:34:08] <abhishekcs10> one should prefer Wiki or blog for their projects...??
[15:34:18] <moizsajid_> !
[15:34:27] <acetakwas> abhishekcs10::  Both (it depends)
[15:34:49] <acetakwas> abhishekcs10::  Your blog mostly would be edited by you alone
[15:34:58] <punarvasu510> next
[15:35:09] <punarvasu510> sorry!
[15:35:10] <acetakwas> But a wiki allows more people to collaboratively edit a document
[15:35:26] <abhishekcs10> +1 acetakwas
[15:35:29] <yoda__> !
[15:35:34] <abhishekcs10> thank you...:)
[15:35:48] <shauryak_3> !
[15:35:51] <sayan> next
[15:35:54] <moizsajid_> Is wiki documentation for end users or for developers?
[15:36:02] <sayan> moizsajid_: both
[15:36:43] <chandankumar> moizsajid, sometimes wiki is used as a white board to share their ideas about the project.
[15:37:13] <moizsajid_> got it!
[15:37:15] <sayan> moizsajid_: developers can have documentation, READMEs as wiki
[15:37:42] <yoda__> is there any doc or blog related to today's class?
[15:37:43] <sayan> moizsajid_: maybe those developers also create pages for end users too
[15:37:47] <sayan> next
[15:38:11] <sayan> yoda__: doc? as in?
[15:38:20] <SRvSaha> !
[15:38:20] <SRvSaha> How is Wiki different from Documentation?
[15:38:37] <sayan> next
[15:38:42] <yoda__> Documentation for any software which open source community use
[15:38:42] <shauryak_3> can someone give me an example of how they used a blog for their project? a link perhaps?
[15:39:40] <praveenkumar> shauryak_3: http://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Main_Page
[15:39:42] <ShaswataD> http://www.slimframework.com/blog/
[15:39:44] <yoda__> How a communication tool works.A general idea which one can go through
[15:40:06] <abhishekcs10> !
[15:40:10] <chandankumar> shauryak_3, like rtnpro uses his blog to talk about his project http://www.rtnpro.com/ircb-0-1-1-released/
[15:40:16] <sayan> shauryak_3: you search for a project's + blog on google
[15:40:22] <sayan> next
[15:40:54] <sayan> next
[15:40:59] <abhishekcs10> How we use laTex for documentation...?
[15:41:06] <SRvSaha> How is Wiki different from Documentation?
[15:41:21] <kushal> abhishekcs10, It is a big thing.
[15:41:27] <kushal> abhishekcs10, Takes time to learn
[15:41:35] <abhishekcs10> is it used in wiki as well..?
[15:41:37] <yASH_> !
[15:41:48] <sayan> Documentation is a generic term
[15:41:51] <lambainsaan> SRvSaha: Wiki answers questions like what is the coding standards that is used in the project while documentation give you the functions present in the framework. Not sure.
[15:42:09] <tejasgadsing> !
[15:42:21] <AndroUser> !
[15:42:23] <acetakwas> sayan::  +1
[15:42:59] <SRvSaha> sayan: Ok. Documentation is the Abstract thing that is made up of wikis, blogs <eof>
[15:42:59] <punarvasu510> SRvSaha Wiki is used for documentation
[15:43:04] <rahuldecoded_> !
[15:43:09] <sayan> Documentation is docs related to a software on how to use it? Installation etc
[15:43:22] <sayan> where wiki is a website maintained by a communnity
[15:43:28] <priyanka> <eof>==?
[15:43:30] <sayan> s/where/whereas
[15:43:31] <acetakwas> In my opinion, "Documentation" is a more formal/official release.
[15:43:32] <sayan> next
[15:43:35] <yASH_> Do I have to use blowfish encryption for this ? Because I heard passwords sent through Nickserv and Chanserv are not encrypted if your connection is not encrypted
[15:44:06] <acetakwas> As a developer you want to check the documentation for technical specifications.
[15:44:17] <moizsajid_> yASH_, good question
[15:44:19] <tabrez> sayan, what is s/where
[15:44:36] <yASH_> Thanks !!

[15:46:01] <abhishekg5_> tabrez, it is used to correct anything you previously wrote wrong
[15:46:06] <acetakwas> AndroUser::  No.
[15:46:10] <CuriousLearner> AndroUser, it depends.
[15:46:11] <praveenkumar> AndroUser: depend on how much you already know about that project.
[15:46:15] <sayan> AndroUser: use ! to ask questions
[15:46:18] <sayan> next
[15:46:19] <rahuldecoded_> respond Inline in email. Should we reply inline the opening thread where Question is asked or we can reply to the responded mail too?

[15:46:56] <tabrez> thanks abhishekg5
[15:47:04] <CuriousLearner> rahuldecoded_, you can respond to any mail. You keep the response inline so that it would be easy to track in what context a reply has been made.
[15:47:05] <praveenkumar> rahuldecoded_: It means you should reply inline to whatever question/query/suggestion you want to make against.
[15:47:07] <sharique> !
[15:47:08] <sayan> rahuldecoded_: reply inline to the email you want to respond
[15:47:14] <sayan> next
[15:47:16] <punarvasu510> What is yaSH talking about? The encryption part. Why do we need it?
[15:47:57] <sayan> punarvasu510: encryption is needed so that no one can spy on our activity
[15:48:00] <sayan> next
[15:48:04] <tabrez> got the answer

[15:48:10] <sayan> next
[15:48:13] <ashim> for higher security purpose
[15:48:33] <yoda__> do we have any framework in python used for communicating?
[15:48:40] <sayan> punarvasu510: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+encryption+needed
[15:49:41] <sayan> yoda__: you need to be specific. which area of communicating?
[15:49:42] <arthar360_> sayan: ðŸ˜„
[15:49:45] <acetakwas> yoda__::  Not sure what you mean. A framework is some code written by someone (even you) which you can usually build an app around.
[15:50:04] <acetakwas> It's a like "skeletal" code.
[15:50:34] <sayan> yoda__: if you are looking for wiki engines - https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonWikiEngines
[15:50:40] * chandankumar will connect from home.
[15:51:13] <sayan> yoda__: if you are looking for Python IRC bouncers - github.com/waartaa/ircb

[15:51:36] <SRvSaha> !
[15:51:39] <yoda__> someone shared the link the link for slime framework which is wriiten in php.I was curious if there is any such framework built in python
[15:51:55] <sayan> Anandprakash_: you can use a debugger like ipdb or pudb
[15:51:56] abhishekg5__ is now known as abhishekg5
[15:52:27] <Anandprakash_> yes I am using it, what about pycallgraph, I want to explore it more..is it a good idea
[15:52:32] <CuriousLearner> yoda__, there are many like web2py, flask, django, tornado etc.
[15:52:35] <SRvSaha> sayan: Is framework the basic thing, on the top of which we can build something. How is it different from an API then?
[15:52:56] <sayan> yoda__: http://flask.pocoo.org/ something that can be compared to slim
[15:52:59] <indiabhi> yoda__, for writing rest apis Django rest framework is good.
[15:53:07] <tabrez> !
[15:53:17] <kushal> We are moving out too much.
[15:53:18] <sayan> next
[15:53:22] <sanketdg> yoda__: PHP and python are fundamentally different languages. As for web frameworks https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python#web-frameworks
[15:53:24] <sharique> can we consider README for a project on git sites as a documentation ?
[15:53:32] <kushal> No more python questions.
[15:53:42] <praveenkumar> sharique: depend on how good that written
[15:53:46] <ashim> !
[15:53:59] <sayan> sharique: yes, but depending on the detail in which it is explained
[15:54:08] <sayan> next

[15:54:39] <SRvSaha> sayan: Is framework the basic thing, on the top of which we can build something. How is it different from an API then?
[15:54:45] <tabrez> sayan, wiki engines means search engines used to search any doc or related material?
[15:54:52] <kushal> SRvSaha, it is not part of the discussion.
[15:54:58] <thisisashwani> SRvSaha: api is there so as to easy your way to use some other application, while building your own!

[16:02:21] <acetakwas> SRvSaha::  GNU is the operating system. Linux is a kernel. (I'll leave you to learn what a Kernel is.)
[16:02:24] <SRvSaha> What is Linux generally referred to as GNU/Linux?
[16:02:25] <manjaroi3_> Linux is simply a kernel. To make it a complete operating system gnu utilities and many other software are required. therefore GNU/Linux
[16:02:33] <chshbh> SRvsaha: because, linux is just a kernel, not the whole operating system, which includes contribution from many, so GNU/Linux signifies the whole os.

[16:08:31] <acetakwas> And you usually get logs of chats, not really the case with voice of course.
[16:08:51] <kushal> next
[16:08:54] <abk> there are some non-free distribution of linux, how are they different? i have googled it only to find about some extra driver support.
[16:09:06] <shobhitupadhyay> +1 prashant
[16:09:17] <shobhitupadhyay> +1 acetakwas
[16:10:01] <priyanka> prashaant, +1
[16:10:24] <indiabhi> !
[16:10:38] <acetakwas> abk::  Mostly that they are owned by companies that offer technical support
[16:10:50] <kushal> Yes, many hardware does not have open source driver.
[16:11:15] <abk> ok :) so its just about the support. thanks
[16:11:45] <sandeepkr> abk, because they contain software that is not free/libre.Interestingly it turns out to be drivers on most occasions.
[16:12:42] <D1mz> even some multimedia codecs like mp3 are not free software
[16:13:08] <sandeepkr> D1mz, good point.
[16:13:47] <vharsh> Rival organizations(AMD vs Nvidea) scared that their competitors will steal their research.
[16:13:48] <kushal> Yes
[16:13:54] <kuldeep> D1mz, "even some multimedia codecs like mp3 are not free software" patent of the codec and implementation are two different things.
[16:13:54] <kushal> we can continue.
[16:13:58] <vharsh> Btw a good article with a horrifying end
[16:13:58] <vharsh> https://fedoramagazine.org/open-source-black-boxes-radioactivity/
[16:13:59] <kushal> next
[16:14:05] <abhishekcs10> So when we use term GNU/Linux which distribution (Ubuntu, Fedora etc.) are we referring to...?
[16:14:07] <sayan> next
[16:14:22] <iKshitij> why dgplug group prefer Fedora over other linux dist ?
[16:15:13] <priyanka> !
[16:15:23] <kushal> iKshitij, because we think it is the best distribution for developers and users.
[16:15:24] <kushal> next
[16:15:33] <rahuldecoded_> iKshitij It is good for developers
[16:15:40] <pksadiq> !
[16:15:44] <kushal> next
[16:15:46] <sayan> next
[16:15:47] <Anandprakash_> can any one please tell me a complete workflow of any linux command..means when we enter a command what is going inside...and how we can see the progress using stacktrace/any other?
[16:16:04] <kushal> Anandprakash_, not part of this class.
[16:16:05] <kushal> next
[16:16:06] <indiabhi> how do u search inside irc logs? does google crawls irc logs as well? More importantly how do i find relevant information from irc logs?
[16:16:10] <priyanka> Kushal, what are some risks associated with Open Source Software?
[16:16:47] <kushal> indiabhi, Open the log in browser, press Ctrl+f to open the find box
[16:16:49] <acetakwas> indiabhi::  Use your web browser's "Find" feature (Ctrl+F)
[16:16:53] <iKshitij> Rahul Can you justify ! How ?
[16:17:08] <kushal> iKshitij, you will learn with time.
[16:17:11] <kushal> next
[16:17:20] <kushal> priyanka, I don't know any.
[16:17:26] <pksadiq> On what basis Fedora is considered to be the best for Developers? I have seen Debian GNU/Linux to have more software and community support
[16:17:30] <rahuldecoded_> !
[16:17:40] <kushal> pksadiq, You will learn it with time.
[16:17:41] <kushal> next
[16:17:52] <iKshitij> Kushal and Rahul Thank You.
[16:17:57] <rahuldecoded_> is irc chats are secured?
[16:18:01] <acetakwas> priyanka::  You could become popular :)
[16:18:07] <sayan> iKshitij: because Fedora works closely with Upstream, has updated packages, you get the latest things on Fedora
[16:18:08] <kuldeep> priyanka, "risks associated..." very broad
[16:18:13] <vharsh> priyanka, Check https://fedoramagazine.org/open-source-black-boxes-radioactivity/
[16:18:21] <chshbh> priyanka: its linear hierarchy can have some disadvantages too.
[16:18:35] <abhishekg5> rahuldecoded_, In what sense ?
[16:18:54] <abhishekcs10> next
[16:18:54] <priyanka> vharsh, okay.
[16:19:02] <acetakwas> rahuldecoded_::  Simply, "No." It's in plain text.
[16:19:13] <sayan> next
[16:19:22] <priyanka> chshbh, okay.
[16:19:39] <kushal> Okay
[16:19:57] <priyanka> acetakwas, means?
[16:20:08] <acetakwas> priyanka::  That's a joke.
[16:20:15] <D1mz> priyanka, AFAIK there are only 2 major distros that offer bleeding edge software, Arch and Fedora. Arch is not for beginners so Fedora is a better choice.
[16:20:16] <kushal> next
[16:20:36] <chshbh> +1
[16:20:44] <priyanka> acetakwas,  ohh.
[16:20:58] <kushal> Next
[16:21:07] <kushal> For tomorrow read this https://dgplug.org/irclogs/mbuf_2ndclass.log
[16:21:11] <kushal> Ooops
[16:21:14] <kushal> wrong link
[16:21:18] <sandeepkr> D1mz, how can you say that arch is not for beginners? im not saying you are wrong im just looking for your reason
[16:21:25] <kuldeep> onething that distinquish Arch and Fedora, Arch is rolling release. `pacman -Syu` and you have all the latest packages
[16:21:43] <kushal> For tomorrow please go through https://dgplug.org/irclogs/mbuf_2ndclass.log
[16:21:47] <kushal> Eeks
[16:21:55] <punarvasu510> !
[16:22:02] <kushal> https://dgplug.org/irclogs/2013/2013-07-17-ncoghlan.log
[16:22:08] <kushal> ^^ read this for tomorrow.
[16:22:09] <kuldeep> with Fedora, one has replace the current with "new release"
[16:22:32] <priyanka> D1mz,  will you explain?
[16:23:07] <sanketdg> kuldeep: Arch definitely takes a lot of setup, whereas Fedora's installation and setup is a breeze compared to that.
[16:23:36] <sanketdg> sandeepkr: ^
[16:23:55] <D1mz> sandeepkr, The difficulty in installation and troubleshooting. This is because every installation is unique and the same solution may not work for everyone
[16:24:43] <acetakwas> When you look at so many tools online, and measure how much support they have for one OS (e.g Fedora vs Arch), you would usually find more of Fedora
[16:24:53] <D1mz> Arch has more chances of breaking when upgraded
[16:25:05] <acetakwas> Or Ubuntu (which I use)
[16:25:30] <abstatic> Ubuntu packages very old software
[16:25:47] <acetakwas> So, with Arch, you have less people holding your hands to guid you.
[16:25:53] <acetakwas> s/guid/guide
[16:26:01] <thisisashwani> kushal: any other readings for tomorrow?
[16:26:12] <iKshitij> kushal log of Jul 17 2013  ?
[16:26:26] <rahuldecoded_> kushal I think the above link is above. So should we install python?
[16:26:28] <D1mz> No Arch has the top notch documentation of all distros
[16:26:31] <prashaant> everyone , don't get sentimental about which distro to use instead focus on the contribution part initially
[16:26:42] <D1mz> +1
[16:26:44] <kuldeep> Arch wiki is one place to get all info its awwsome. and afair there is a fork of Arch in which they are working for "beginners"
[16:26:48] <rahuldecoded_> kushal I think the above link is about python. So should we install python?
[16:26:55] <sayan> Read the link kushal gave
[16:26:56] <chshbh> +1
[16:27:01] <abstatic> +1 kuldeep D1mz
[16:27:04] <vharsh> rahuldecoded_, python is there in most distros
[16:27:05] <rahuldecoded_> sayan ok
[16:27:09] <priyanka> +1 prashaant
[16:27:18] <sayan> And tomorrow you would require a Linux distro
[16:27:25] <android> !
[16:27:30] <sayan> so get it ready those who have not yet
[16:27:31] <sayan> next
[16:27:34] <punarvasu510> Once we type "!", is there any way to get out of the queue?
[16:27:35] <sayan> next
[16:27:58] <sandy_> !
[16:27:59] <sayan> punarvasu510: no, maybe you can send a PR, first contribution :)
[16:28:01] <sayan> next
[16:28:01] <android> how to contribute in open source as a beginner
[16:28:07] <vharsh> !
[16:28:17] <sandy_> what is best to dual boot or installon virtual
[16:28:28] <sayan> android: you will learn that here itself
[16:28:30] <sayan> next
[16:28:34] <anushil051> sandy_ dual boot
[16:28:36] <vharsh> How about recommending a documentary/movie related to linux/etc etc?
[16:28:41] <abstatic> sandy_ setting up dual boot is tricky. you might lose your data
[16:28:44] <rohan_h> android, https://sayanchowdhury.dgplug.org/how-to-get-started-with-open-source/
[16:28:46] <vharsh> I know one of them, Revolution OS
[16:28:53] <grepRoot> +1
[16:29:15] <sayan> sandy_:  it good to get Linux install by somebody who knows if you are not that confident
[16:29:23] <grepRoot> You will get to know the FSF and open source debate.
[16:29:27] <sayan> else go for virtual installation
[16:29:27] <sandy_>  abstatic so what method should i prefer?
[16:29:28] <sandeepkr> vharsh, i guess thats the only one.I might be wrong.
[16:29:29] <ShaswataD> vharsh, Aaron Swartz : Internets Own Boy
[16:29:55] <sayan> vharsh: google, plenty out there
[16:30:02] <grepRoot> +1, though you would mostly learn about aaron's life..
[16:30:05] <vharsh> sandeepkr, There's one more "Code story linux", "Code rush" -> Mozilla
[16:30:06] <kuldeep> vharsh, RMS talks and gnu.org are useful to understand in broader view
[16:30:12] <gkadam> vharsh, Person of Interest or Mr. Robot
[16:30:20] <mayurparik> what about installing dual boot, UEFI and Legacy
[16:30:21] <vharsh> Please recommend us some.
[16:30:21] <abstatic> sandy_ try installing on a vm first. if you feel comfortable then try dual boot. level of difficulty depends on the other os win7 < win8 < win10
[16:30:48] <sandeepkr> +1 kuldeep
[16:30:51] <sayan> next
[16:30:58] <vharsh> mayurparik, Plenty of videos on youtube.
[16:31:02] <sandy_> sayan: ther is no nobody in my circle who know, first i try to install ubuntu but can't
[16:31:31] <grepRoot> gkadam, +1 for POI but that is fiction but good for motivation.
[16:31:57] <indiabhi> haha Machine :p
[16:31:59] <chshbh> sandy_ : try Ubuntu on VMware, plenty of tutorials on how-to
[16:32:15] <gkadam> mayurparik, you need to check if uefi is enabled, or legacy support is enabled. by default uefi will support GPT partition , so you need to be aware of GPT, MBR and other things.
[16:32:21] <shauryak_3> sandy_, search on youtube you will find plenty of videos to dual boot
[16:32:22] <pabitrapati> I am not getting what we are  discussing  on vharsh's question
[16:32:32] <abk> youtube shows exactly how to install a linux distro plus google it'
[16:32:34] <sandy_> sayan: ended changing my all drive  from primary to basic drive ,try create an empty partition but didn't work out
[16:32:42] <anushil051> sandy_:it's simple just make a bootable and make root,swap,home directory and install
[16:32:52] <pabitrapati>  recommending a documentary/movie related to linux/etc etc
[16:33:07] <gkadam> grepRoot, yes. harold and root are my motivation! :D
[16:33:36] <grepRoot> gkadam: Oh, yeah!
[16:34:06] <grepRoot> is the session over?
[16:34:09] <code_geek> sandy_, to install ubuntu alongside windows, refer to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FuLXIKLVjg
[16:34:10] <iKshitij> !
[16:34:18] <sandy_> anushil051: i try but when i choose 3rd option it show one c: drive and other all drive combine
[16:34:19] <prashaant> grepRoot, no
[16:34:21] <D1mz> I think persistent live usb is also a good alternative to dual boot
[16:34:26] <iKshitij> Sayan When I was trying to install Fedora dual boot with windows. (Windows PreInstalled). I was getting error " ". I asked the same on fedora forum. They asked me to change Drive to GPT from GMR. what is GPT or GMR
[16:34:46] <abstatic> D1mz, +1  but the OS of choice should be lightweight like puppy or lubuntu
[16:34:50] <sandy_> code_geek: thank's  i will see
[16:34:51] * sayan got disconnected
[16:34:59] <mayurparik> +1 iKshitij

[16:35:22] <gkadam> iKshitij, it is MBR
[16:35:26] <ShaswataD> is the session over?
